Sort.TimSort.description = "<strong>NOT IMPLEMENTED YET</strong> Timsort is a hybrid sorting algorithm, derived from merge sort and insertion sort, designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data. It is used in the Python programming language. The algorithm finds subsets of the data that are already ordered, and uses that knowledge to sort the remainder more efficiently. This is done by merging an identified subset, called a run, with existing runs until certain criteria are fulfilled. Timsort has been Python's standard sorting algorithm since version 2.3. It is used to sort arrays in Java SE 7, on the Android platform, and in GNU Octave.";
